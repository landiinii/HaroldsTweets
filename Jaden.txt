Jealousy Just Reassures Your Love. You Do Not Know Who You Are Or
Why Your Here So When You See Someone Who Dose The Society Comes 
Together As A Whole And Destroys Them.To The Artist Of This Coming 
Generation And Of The Renaissance. The People That Truly Understand
Your Art are The People Who Don't Comment I Encourage You All To
Unfollow Me So I Can Be Left With The People Who Actually Appreciate
Philosophy And Poetry. #CoolTapeVol2 We Need To Stop Teaching The 
Youth About The Past And Encourage Them To Change The Future. There 
Is No Nutrients In Our Food Anymore Or In Our Soil OR IN OUR WATER.
I Should Just Stop Tweeting, The Human Consciousness Must Raise 
Before I Speak My Juvenile Philosophy. Gravity is the greatest film 
of our generation. The Great Gatsby Is One Of The Greatest Movies Of 
All Time, Coachella. Everybody Get Off Your Phones And Go Do What 
You Actually Wanna Do If Everybody In The World Dropped Out Of 
School We Would Have A Much More Intelligent Society. If Newborn 
Babies Could Speak They Would Be The Most Intelligent Beings On Planet
Earth. Education Is Rebellion. School Is The Tool To Brainwash The Youth.
People Use To Ask Me What Do You Wanna Be When You Get Older And I Would
Say What A Stupid Question The Real Question Is What Am I Right Now If A 
Book Store Never Runs Out Of A Certain Book, Dose That Mean That Nobody 
Reads It, Or Everybody Reads It "It's Your Birthday" Mateo Said. I Didn't
Respond. "Are You Not Excited To Be 15" He Asked. Reading My Book I
Uttered "I Turned 15 Long Ago" I Honestly Love When People Hate Even
When There Close To You. Ill Never Forget The Blogs That Believed In 
Me Since The Begging. I Only Apply To The Sixth Amendment I Will Always
Give You The Truth I Will Never Lie To You In My music If You Cant
Handle My Feelings And Emotions Please Unfollow Me
